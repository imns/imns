# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nate

Welcome to my corner of Github. I'm a longtime software engineer specializing in the art of JavaScript and TypeScript. Currently, I'm venturing into the world of Rust, fascinated by its performance and safety features. I thrive on creating tools that simplify the complex, always with a keen eye on the horizon for the next challenge.

## ðŸ”­ What's keeping me busy ...

I'm leading the charge at Pathpoint, steering my talented team towards building scalable and efficient software systems. 

## ðŸŒŸ Highlighted Creations

- **[Dvori](https://github.com/dvorijs/dvori)** - Simplify your API interactions with Dvori. It's my take on making HTTP requests straightforward and environment-agnostic. Check out the [website](https://dvorijs.com/) to explore more.
- **[DurableWS](https://github.com/imns/durablews)** - A testament to my love for TypeScript, DurableWS stands as a resilient WebSocket client designed to endure. It's the robust, real-time communication channel you didn't know you needed.
- **[TSCRDT](https://github.com/imns/TSCRDT)** - Delve into the depths of CRDTs with this library. It's a project born from my curiosity about distributed systems and my quest to unravel the mysteries of conflict-free replicated data types.

Each project is a chapter in my story, a step towards understanding the vast landscape of software engineering.
